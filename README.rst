Hjson, the Human JSON. A configuration file format that caters to humans and helps reduce the errors they make.

It supports `#`, `//` and `/**/` style comments as well as avoiding trailing/missing comma and other mistakes. For details and syntax see http://laktak.github.io/hjson.

Hjson works with Python 2.5+ and Python 3.3+ (forked from simplejson)

API: See the simplejson docs: http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/

BETA::

*The parser is implemented and fully functional.*

The encoder currently outputs JSON but will return Hjson in a future update.

Please test and report bugs.
